Hello there!

I'm a PhD student in the [Climate, Energy and Machine Learning Systems](https://www.mlsustainableenergy.com/) group at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). Currently, I'm visiting David Rolnick's lab at Mila – Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Montréal, Canada. 

In my research, I use Machine Learning methods to study the impact of climate change on renewable energy.

Please feel free to reach out in English or German if you're interested in these topics!
