Hello!

I am a PhD student in the [Climate, Energy and Machine Learning Systems group](https://www.mlsustainableenergy.com/) at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). Currently, I am a visiting researcher in David Rolnick's lab at Mila – Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Montréal, Canada. 

In my research, I use Machine Learning methods to understand how future climate change impacts renewable energy. Please feel free to reach out in English or German if you're interested in these topics!
